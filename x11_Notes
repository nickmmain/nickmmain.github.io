Still to add to X11 artcile, May 21-2021

Why startlxde-pi and not lxsession ? 

Is it better to just use VNC ? What is VNC ?   

Why can't you close the frickin' Xming panel or window :'(

Was it necessary to copy the .Xauthority file into /root ?
--> No.

Wipe yoru Pi and do the whole thing from scratch.
--> but first, save your configs....


Removed this stuff: 
**WSL**

You can skip using Putty by using WSL. Follow the instructions here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
Once done, install the Linux distro of your choice from the Microsoft Store.

Launch your distro of choice. Then set your DISPLAY environment variable:

`export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0`

(which can be automated at your distro's boot up)

and then contact your pi:

`ssh -X pi@192.168.137.196`

The -X enables X11 forwarding.
