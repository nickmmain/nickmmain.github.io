**Background**
In the Fall of 2020 I took a course At Polytechnique Montreal called Multimedia Applications. The course was a review of the major developments in image, video, and text processing and the applications which they serve. For example, the course covers the SIFT algorithm, bilateral filtering, and tf-idf in the applications of object recognition, image processing (like Adobe Photoshop), and full-text search, respectively.
