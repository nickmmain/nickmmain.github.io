**The no-monitor life**

For whatever reason you may not want to purchase a monitor and you work on your laptop. Maybe you can't afford the one you want right now, or maybe you don't have the space in your apartment/van. 

So maybe, like me, you've been launching Flask web app every time you wanted to view your picam video feed. I recently took a little dive into the X Window System, and it's less fuss. 

**To get going**

1. Start as you usually do by opening an SSH connection to the pi. 
2. Have an Xclient installed on the remote device. On the Raspberry pi it should already be installed. Try `startx` in a terminal on your pi to find out.
2. If the PC with a display is running Windows, install Xming. 
3. Run Xming. If the icon shows up in your Task Bar (bottom right), it's running.  
3. Using Putty, open an SSH connection to the Pi's IP address, with X11 forwarding enabled to `localhost:0`

But what if you don't want to go through Putty every time ? After all we want to eliminate steps here.
The answer: Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). 

Follow the instructions here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
Once done, install the Linux distro of your choice from the Microsoft Store. 

Launch your distro of choice. Then set your DISPLAY environment variable:

`export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0`

(which of course can be automated at your distro's boot up) 

and then contact your pi:

`ssh -X pi@192.168.137.196`

**Xserver, X11 forwarding, etc.**

What's with all the X's ? It all comes back to something called the X Window System.
Applications requiring a UI use the X Window System to draw themselves on a screen. Two particular features of the X Window System are: 

- it's disinterest in your use case; it was developed to be useful in a wide variety of programs.
- it's client-server architecture.

The first point there is interesting, but the second is what I want to focus on. Did you think it was bizare that the Xclient is installed on the Raspberry pi ? 
It's "remote", shouldn't it be the server ?

The key is that the *program* is the client. In the case of CV2 running on your Raspi, CV2 is the client which is sending requests to the server running on your Windows PC.
